### Why a cat?
Cats are cute.

### How can I get help running this bot?
We don't typically offer support running Maidy or Soapy, as we encourage most who need SOAPs to visit our community directly. Feel free to [join](https://discord.gg/qNZePF6RxP) and ask your question if you want, but there is no guarantee of a response.
